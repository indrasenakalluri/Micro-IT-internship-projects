Python Mini Projects Collection 🐍
 Overview

I developed these Python mini projects to strengthen my programming fundamentals and gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications using Python. These projects helped me understand core concepts such as functions, conditional statements, loops, arithmetic operations, and user interaction through the command-line interface.

This repository contains the following projects:

Quiz Game

Currency Converter

These projects demonstrate my ability to design logical solutions and implement them using Python.

 Project 1: Quiz Game
 Description

I developed a command-line based Quiz Game application using Python. This application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and provides instant feedback on their responses. At the end of the quiz, the system displays the total score.

Through this project, I learned how to manage user input, implement logical conditions, and structure programs using functions and lists.

🚀 Features

Interactive multiple-choice quiz

Instant feedback for each answer

Automatic score calculation

Final performance summary

Easy to modify and extend

 Technologies Used

Python 3

Command Line Interface

▶️ How to Run
python quiz_game.py

 Project 2: Currency Converter
📖 Description

I developed a simple Currency Converter using Python to perform arithmetic-based currency conversions. This project helped me understand mathematical operations and how to implement calculation logic in Python.

It demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators, user input handling, and basic program flow.

 Features

Performs currency conversion

Simple and efficient logic

Beginner-friendly implementation

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

▶️ How to Run
python currency_converter.py

 Skills Gained

Through these projects, I gained practical experience in:

Python programming

Problem-solving and logical thinking

Functions and modular programming

Conditional statements

Loops and iteration

User input handling

Command-line application development

 Future Improvements

I plan to enhance these projects by adding:

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Real-time currency conversion using API

Database integration

Score tracking system

Advanced features and improved user experience
